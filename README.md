## 🧠 How It Works

1. On app launch, user's location is fetched using GPS.
2. Based on location:
   - Nearby emergency services are fetched.
   - Country is detected to display embassy.
3. SOS button sends real-time alert to:
   - Emergency contacts (via SMS)
   - Embassy (via email if unresponsive)
4. Countdown timer checks if user cancels the alert.
5. Embassy gets notified with name, GPS link, and timestamp.
